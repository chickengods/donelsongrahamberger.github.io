title: Functinoal Geometry of the Brain
summary: I used Diffusion Map Embedding to get the underlying functional geometry of the brain to gain insight into how different regions of the brain interact and how non-random sampling effects electrophysiological recording's descriptions of the brain.

After [InfoMap]({{site.url}}/projects/infomap), the project I spent the rest of my time working on at [Banks Lab](https://bankslab.wiscweb.wisc.edu/) was using [Diffusion Map Embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_map) to understand the underlying functional geometry of the brain. Diffusion Map Embedding was inspired by high dimensional data analysis, it assumes that your data lies on a low dimensional structure or manifold, and this methods seeks to map your data into a low dimensional space, which uncovers its underlying geometry. There is some amazing math, mostly linear algebra, that goes into this method. If you want to know more about the math check out these papers [Diffusion maps](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yaoy/Fall2011/Lafon06.pdf) and [Diffusion Maps for changing data](https://math.msu.edu/user_content/docs/1-s2.0-S1063520313000225-main20190706230036666.pdf).

We want to figure how functionally similar different region of interest (ROIs) within the brain are. First, we create a Markov model of a given set of ROIs that we want to compare. We take the pairwise correction between ROIs, then with some prepossessing and normalization we have a Markov model, where a ROI pair's transition probability is high if their is a correlation between when they are activated. With Diffusion Map Embedding, we can map our Markov Model into 'Diffusion Space', where Euclidean distance now equates to functional familiarity in our Markov model. The closer two ROIs are the more similar they are. This new space is N-dimensional, where N is the number of ROI we are comparing. Each dimension don't hold the same weight though. For each dimension there is a spectral value, where higher value mean that dimension explains more variance in the data. From these values we can determine how many dimension we think explain the majority of variance in our data.

I used this method on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intracranial electrophysiological (iEEG) data, to answer two questions. How similar is fMRI and iEEG data and how does non-random sampling effect iEEG's description of the brain? fMRI and iEEG both measure brain activity but in completely different ways, one with magnetism and the other with voltage, so the question raises do they capturing the same information. I was able to show that there is some correlation, ~0.35 r-value. This value was skewed towards 0 due a few outliers. For the second quetion, the problem with iEEG data is that you can never record from every ROI within a subject and even within the ROI you record from you can't cover the entire ROI. How does this sparse sampling effect the geometry that we are getting? I found that there was almost no information is lost when using a subset of ROIs. However, sparse sampling of a given ROI does give a worse description of that ROI, effecting the geometry of our embedding. The gif above is the averaged embedding across all iEEG patients, if you were wondering.
