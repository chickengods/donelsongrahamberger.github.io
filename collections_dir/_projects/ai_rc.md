One of my long term goals is to own a self-driving car. However, it doesn't seem like that is going to happen anytime soon. The closets I could get in the next 5 years is getting a car that is compatible with one of [Comma AI's](https://comma.ai/) products. consequently, I went to the next best thing, a self driving RC car. I was inspired to do this when I learned about the [Doneky Car project](https://www.donkeycar.com/), a community all about DIY self driving RC cars.
