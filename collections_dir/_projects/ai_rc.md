title: AI Remote Controlled Car
summary: I Jerry-rigged a Jeston Nano onto my childhood RC car and have been trying to make my own self driving RC car.

One of my long term goals is to own a self-driving car. However, it doesn't seem like that is going to happen anytime soon. Consequently, I went to the next best thing, a self driving remote controlled car. I was inspired by [The Doneky Car project](https://www.donkeycar.com/), a community all about DIY self driving RC cars. So, I found my old RC car tore it apart, built a frame from cardboard, then slapped a [Jeston Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/), [PCA9685](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815), and a [Pi camera](https://www.amazon.com/Arducam-Megapixels-Sensor-OV5647-Raspberry/dp/B012V1HEP4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&hvadid=78340329921794&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=raspberry+pi+camera&qid=1629817945&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyM0E4OEcwQlRSNVZPJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTEwMTY5MUpUMDNRMzNCTUxQTyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzY0ODAyMlVFWFA2U0tFNjVHUyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) on top. BAM! A RC car but with extra steps. After calibrating the steering and acceleration, I was able to control the car from a locally hosted web server. Next are the fun steps.

Donkey Car provides a framework to train a self-driving agent through supervised learning. To do this, you launch a simulation and drive yourself for a while, then based on the image and input data it trains the agent. It is a simple and fast way to train your first self-driving car. I was able to get ok results but I don't like this approach. The problem I have is that it relies on me to generate the data. I order to get a robust agent I would've had to drive in the simulation for hours, and I wasn't going to do this. Also, driving in the simulation was surprisingly hard, which makes getting good data frustrating. I felt discouraged and didn't want to continue this project, until I found [RLDonekycar](https://github.com/downingbots/RLDonkeycar) repo. What a great idea! Why teach the car when it can teach itself. Currently, I'm in the process of using reinforcement learning to teach an agent to drive. I was only able to dip my toes in before I became too busy with school, research and my summer internship, but since then this project has been put on the back burner. However, once I have to time I wanna use Actor-Critic to create my dream self driving RC car.
